The department is currently in faculty hiring season, and the faculty
needs your input!

Each faculty candidate will give a talk and meet with graduate students
(we will email you with the time slot for each candidate). The faculty
seriously care about what you think of the candidates, and want your
feedback.

[THERE IS ALSO FREE FOOD DURING THE TALK.]

The process is simple:

1. Attend the talk and/or the graduate student meeting with the candidate.

2. Determine how you feel about having the candidate. REMEMBER: This
person may become your future advisor or a research collaborator!

3. Distill your thoughts into an email to your graduate representatives
(gradrep@cs.umass.edu), or speak to one of us in private.

We will collect your thoughts together, and present them *anonymously* to
the faculty during faculty meetings. We will also use your thoughts to
inform how we vote for or against candidates. Sometimes, we'll use your
feedback to lobby the faculty into changing their opinions of candidates.

Hope to see you at the talks and the student meetings!


The first talks are this week:
